# Background/Motivation
- This project deploys Alpaca-LoRA to fine-tune the LlaMA2 model for analyzing gold prices via news articles. It gathers diverse gold-related news from reputable sources, preprocesses it, and integrates sentiment analysis. Alpaca-LoRA optimizes the LlaMA2 model, enhancing its relevance in the gold price analysis. LlaMA2 undergoes fine-tuning, incorporating insights from the adapted model for precise gold price prediction. This novel approach refines large language models, enabling a new approach to the analysis of gold prices from news data, and aiding informed financial decision-making.
